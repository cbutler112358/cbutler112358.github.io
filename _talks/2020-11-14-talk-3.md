I presented some of my personal research of a predator-prey system with parasitic infection
at e-BEER in 2020. The poster I made is attached below. Originally the project started out as a 
fun side project in NetLogo, with the goal of illustrating existence between a predator (represented by
sheep), prey (the grass of a pasture), and a parasite (<i> H. contortus</i>). Eventually it grew
to encompass a class project, and I was so interested in the results that I shared them at e-BEER.
