I gave a talk virtually at TAGMaC 2020 about the research I did as an undergraduate mathematically 
modeling the opioid epidemic in Maine. Since then, the project has become more ambitious in studying
a general model of the opioid epidemic (for any state) using Maine as a case study. This research
was funded in large part by the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center at the University of Maine.
