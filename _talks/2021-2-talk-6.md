I gave a talk at MathFest as part of a contributed paper session on using modeling in differential equations 
courses. In this talk, I highlighted my own experience using these methods in my mentorship
activities, as well as emphasizing the use of computational tools (e.g. NetLogo) to demonstrate
important concepts.
