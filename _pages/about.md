<h1>
About
</h1>

<p> I am a first year graduate student in the Biomathematics 
Ph.D. program at North Carolina State University. I received a B.Sc. in 
Mathematics with highest honors from the University of Maine in 2016 (my undergraduate
thesis can be found <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/630/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). 
I grew up in Auburn, ME where
I developed a fascination for infectious diseases and mathematics, although I spent the first
years at my undergraduate institution studying to become a civil engineer! Eventually, I 
committed myself to a degree in mathematics after my REU experience at the 
Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute at Arizona State University, 
and a grant project I worked on with Prof. David Hiebeler. This is also around
the time when I became interested in programming to assist in some of my 
computational-oriented work, developing advanced knowledge in R, MATLAB, and 
NetLogo, to name a few. </p>

<p>
This website is a mishmash of some of the things I've been up to, including past and current projects,
presentations, etc. I will also occasionally make a blog post every few weeks about something I found interesting
during that time. These topics tend to be more general and don't always have to do with epidemiology. Also,
for some reason or another, the pages may look a little funky if you have an AdBlocker enabled.

Research Interests
</h1>

<p>
Broadly speaking, my research interests are in the mathematical modeling 
of biological systems, specifically those concerning the spread and control 
of infectious diseases. As an undergraduate, my formal projects consisted
of researching metapopulation analogues of superspreaders, comparing control strategies
for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07711" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">nosocomial transmission of MRSA</a>, 
applications of topological
concepts to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer, developing a <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/630/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">mathematical model of the opioid epidemic</a>,
some work modeling simple
populations over heterogeneous landscapes, and many more. 
</p>

<p>
As a graduate student, my interests have narrowed to mathematical models that utilize genetic information
or that make use of genetic tools in order to control disease spread. Developments in our ability 
to study and analyze genetic information in recent decades have 
revolutionized the life sciences. In particular, genetics help shed light on many pertinent 
issues at the center of our struggle with infectious disease, from antibiotic resistance 
to zoonotic spillover. This knowledge also informs how we control disease, with gene 
drive technology being a relevant and promising example. These tools have already fundamentally changed the 
landscape of our fight with infectious 
disease. Mathematically, these innovations will change how we model disease spread and 
give rise to new systems benefiting from quantitative analysis. 
</p>

It is for these reasons that when I enrolled at NCSU, I became a student in the 
<a href="https://ggi.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Genetics and Genomics Initiative</a>. This was in order to enhance my 
understanding of the genetic mechanisms behind infectious disease, as well as the tools
and techniques employed by scientists to study them. I am currently a 
member of the <a href="http://alun.math.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Lloyd lab</a>, where I hope to do research on
gene drive technology and its potential in mitigating disease burden. I am currently studying how 
density-dependence determines the effectiveness of gene drive performance in a population of mosquitoes,
and how this influences disease control efforts. I am also working with Prof. Peter Stechlinski 
from the University of Maine on a general mathematical model of the opioid epidemic.
