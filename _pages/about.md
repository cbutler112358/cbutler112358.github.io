<p>
This website is a mishmash of things related to me and my work. I occasionally make a blog post about something I find interesting. These topics tend to be more general than those I pursue in my research. The webpages on this site may look a little funky if you have an adblocker enabled.

<h1>
Research Interests
</h1>

<p>
Broadly, I use data-driven models to answer questions related to pathogen transmission and pest dispersal. My work is highly interdisciplinary. I collaborate with researchers in disparate fields as I deeply enjoy working with and learning from others.

About
</h1>

<p>
I am a postdoctoral research scholar in the Department of Entomology at the University of Georgia,
where I work with 
<a href="https://site.caes.uga.edu/agroecology/bill-snyder-2/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Bill Snyder</a>. My current work focuses on developing models for agricultural pest forecasting and management. 
</p>

<p> 
I received my Ph.D. in the Biomathematics from 
North Carolina State University, where I was advised by Drs.
<a href="http://alun.math.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Alun Lloyd</a> 
and <a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/entomology-and-plant-pathology/people/fgould/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Gould</a>. My dissertation, titled <i>The Role of Genetics in Pest Population Control</i>, can be read 
<a href="https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/items/dd2052b4-aae7-4b72-a197-6837baf99c87" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
At NC State, I was a <a href="https://gga.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Genetics and Genomics Scholar</a>, 
and a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. I received a B.S. in 
Mathematics with highest honors from the University of Maine in 2020 (my undergraduate
thesis can be found <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/630/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).
