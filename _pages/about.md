Research Interests
</h1>

<p>
Broadly, I am interested in questions related to pest and pathogen dispersal. My work is highly interdisciplinary and spans many subjects&mdash;in the past, I have worked with geneticists, molecular biologists, and entomologists. I collaborate with researchers in disparate fields as I deeply enjoy working with and learning from other people.

<p>
I am a postdoctoral research scholar in the Department of Entomology at the University of Georgia,
where I work with

<p> I received my Ph.D. in the Biomathematics from 
North Carolina State University, where I was advised by Drs.
<a href="http://alun.math.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Alun Lloyd</a> 
and <a href="https://cals.ncsu.edu/entomology-and-plant-pathology/people/fgould/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Gould</a>. I am a <a href="https://gga.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Genetics and Genomics Scholar</a>, 
and a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. I received a B.S. in 
Mathematics with highest honors from the University of Maine in 2020 (my undergraduate
thesis can be found <a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/630/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). After a brief period studying civil engineering, I pursued a degree in mathematics after my REU experience at the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute at Arizona State University.

This website is a mishmash of some of the things I've been up to, including past and current projects,
presentations, etc. I will also occasionally make a blog post every so often about some of the things I find interesting. 
These topics tend to be more general than those I pursue in my research. The webpages on this site may look a little funky if you have an AdBlocker enabled.
