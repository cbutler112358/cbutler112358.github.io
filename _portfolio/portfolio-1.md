title: "Gene drives and their potential to control disease"
excerpt: "As part of a broader study of gene drives in controlling vector-borne diseases, I am specifically
looking at how density-dependent dynamics in populations effect gene drive performance and subsequent disease
control efforts. <br/><img src='/images/download_resize.png'>"

I am currently researching the capability of gene drives to control the transmission of
mosquito-borne diseases in the <a href="http://alun.math.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Lloyd lab</a>.
So far, my research concerns how density-dependence in mosquito
populations effects gene drive performance. 

In general, I hope to use this opportunity
to further explore the interplay between coupled disease and population genetic models.
