Since my third year as an undergraduate, I have been studying the opioid epidemic in Maine
and working toward a mathematical model to capture its dynamics. The end goal of this 
project is to hopefully inform control measures in the future, and give us an idea of where we're headed.
I have been performing this reserch with the help of Prof. Peter Stechlinski at the University of Maine.

This project was originally funded by a public affairs scholarship from the
<a href="https://mcspolicycenter.umaine.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center</a> at
the University of Maine, and culminated in my 
<a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/630/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">undergraduate thesis</a>.

We are continuing to work on the project in a more general sense with the state of Maine as a case study. We hope
to submit a manuscript sometime in the next year, so stay tuned!
