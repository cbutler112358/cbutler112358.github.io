Many pest populations are regulated by density-dependent factors. One example of this is in the yellow 
fever mosquito, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, where larval survival is affected by intraspecific larval competition.
Reducing adult populations of 
<i>Aedes aegypti</i> can reduce the number of larvae, which can paradoxically lead to an <i>increase</i> in
the number of adults in the system if intraspecific larval competition is substantially reduced. 
I am interested in how these factors are quantitatively studied and how our assumptions about density dependence
change projected population suppression. This work is now available as a preprint on bioRxiv; read it
