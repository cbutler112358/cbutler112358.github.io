Since my third year as an undergraduate, I developed and analyzed data-driven mathematical models of the opioid
epidemic in New England, with Maine as a case study. This work was performed with Prof. Peter Stechlinski at the 
University of Maine. Alongside predicting the future course of the epidemic and identifying key parameters,
this work included interesting methods in uncertainty quantification. 

This project was originally funded by a public affairs scholarship from the
<a href="https://mcspolicycenter.umaine.edu/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center</a> at
the University of Maine, and culminated in my

Our work was published in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, read it
