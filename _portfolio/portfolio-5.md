title: "Screening for insecticide resistance in local mosquitoes"
excerpt: "During the summer of 2023, I collected nearly 1000 <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes from 31 
different residential locations across the city of Raleigh with the goal of determining the present extent of 
insecticide resistance.

Pyrethroids are the primary insecticides employed against mosquitoes in suburban North Carolina. These insecticides
work by disrupting normal nerve cell function, causing a knockdown effect. Resistance to these insecticides
is known as "knockdown resistance", or <i>kdr</i> for short. The main biting
pest in our backyards is the tiger mosquito, <i>Aedes albopictus</i>. 

Researchers first genetically identified <i>kdr</i> in Raleigh <i>Ae. albopictus</i> populations in 2020. This is important
not only for the risk to public health the now-resistant species poses, but because <i>kdr</i> in <i>Ae. albopictus</i>
is relatively understudied. 

During the summer of 2023, I collected nearly 1,000 <i>Ae. albopictus</i> mosquitoes from 31 
different residential locations across the city of Raleigh with the goal of determining the present extent of 
insecticide resistance. DNA extraction and sequencing is underway, with the next step being a statistical
analysis to determine predictors of <i>kdr</i> in local mosquitoes.
