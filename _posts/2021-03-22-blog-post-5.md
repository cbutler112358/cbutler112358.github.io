<p>
I was reminded the other day of an interesting concept I read about sometime ago, called the 
<i>critical community size</i> of an epidemic. The idea, first introduced by Bartlett [1], is
that a community must be of a certain size in order for an epidemic to persist indefinitely
(that is, the size required for an epidemic to become <i>endemic</i>). Bartlett first discussed this idea in the
context of measles, in which he theorized the critical community size of measles is between
250,000-300,000 people. Any measles epidemic in a community with a population less than this would 
eventually "fadeout," or disappear. This is because the number of susceptibles
in the population decline until eventually reaching an amount insufficient to allow for 
continued spread of the pathogen!
</p>

<p>
Although some of the conclusions presented in [1] have been debated since its publication
(see e.g. the discussion in [2] for details), the fundamental takeaway remains interesting. 
Many scientists (and news 
outlets, it would seem) lean heavily on the basic reproduction number of a disease in order to 
assess its capability to spread in a population. The truth of the matter is, however, 
that there are many 
numeric quantities that allow scientists to characterize a disease. Although not as popular, the critical 
community size still helps us understand the capability of a disease 
to remain in a population - a piece of information regretfully ignored if we were to only look at the
basic reproduction number. I'm not downplayig the utility of this 
constant, I'm merely stating that there is much more to an epidemic than a single number! 
</p>

<p>
To help intuit the idea of a crtical community size a little more clearly, I wrote a program
for a discrete-time SIRS model that takes place on a square grid. Each individual in the grid 
makes contact with their four cardinal neighbors - above, below, left, and right. 
The individuals contact all four of their
neighbors only once per time step. Upon contact, infectious individuals will transmit the disease
with probability $\beta$. If disease transmission is successful, infectious people will 
recover with probability $\gamma$. Recovered individuals eventually 
lose immunity with probability $\delta$ during each time step. An example simulation of the 
grid model is given in Figure 1. Note how even if the assumption of
temporary immunity is relaxed, the susceptible population can still be replenished by processes of
e.g. birth or immigration. Elaborating on his ideas, Bartlett used a discrete-time SI model 
in his original paper, assuming that the susceptible population was replenished at a constant rate.

    <figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> A discrete-time SIRS model running on a grid of 2500 individuals to illustrate
the concept of critical community size. Note that the edges do not wrapover on themselves. 
Each "pixel" on the grid is an individual - purple indicating susceptible, brownish-yellow 
indicating infectious, and bright yellow indicating recovered. I would have chosen a better color palette
but the <span style="font-family:courier;">image()</span> function in R is rather 
picky when it comes to specifying colors. 
The epidemic in this simulation eventually burns out. The parameters used to generate the simulation 
are $\beta = 0.25$, $\gamma = 0.2$, and $\delta = 0.05$. </figcaption>

<p>
Since the model is discrete, events are distributed geometrically. That is, taking
recovery as an example, if individuals recover with probability $\gamma$ per time step, then the 
probability that they
recover $x$ days following infection is $(1-\gamma)^{x-1}\gamma^x$. The average infectious period is
then $1/\gamma$ and, similarly, the average time that an individual possesses immunity is $1/\delta$. 
These results are nice, as they're similar to what we'd expect under the assumption of constant rates
in continuous-time ODE models. However, this is the extent of the "niceness," as
discrete-time models tend to be a lot more difficult to analyze! Some of this complexity is 
explained in a

Getting back to the model, we can approximate the critical community size of our system by looking 
at when fadeout is the predominant outcome of the epidemic. Although there is no standard from 
which to go by, we can set the threshold at $50\%$ for the sake of demonstration. It should be noted that
even successful epidemics can die off just due to the stochastic nature of the simulation. That being said,
it helps to have a large numbers of simulated epidemics to go off of - a small sample size isn't useful if
the goal is prediction. I settled at only 100 simulations, although I admit this is rather small - I usually
go with at least 200 simulations, but I had to use my laptop for a project I had due the week I made this 
post. Finally,
since it's near impossible to determine permanence in a discrete-time simulation, I set the cutoff point 
at two years. Therefore, any epidemic that made it to the two year mark is assumed permanent. The population
in the simulation is varied by changing the side lengths of the grid, so that data points are all square numbers.
The results for each population are plotted in Figure 2.

<p>
Based on the results of the stochastic simulations, the critical community size of the 
hypothetical disease is around $39^2 - 42^2$, or a population of anywhere from 1521 to 1764. 
Below this population the
epidemic will fadeout within two years, while above this population it will persist a majority of the time.
As the population becomes larger, fadeouts become more infrequent over the course of the two years.

Indeed, what is meant by "community" is quite debatable, as a community in western Europe may not look or behave
like a community in southeast Asia. Even more, communities worldwide have changed quite dramatically since the 
year that Bartlett originally formulated the concept! Such a metric is still useful, however, as it 
tells us how transmissible a disease is (measles has a much higher critical community size than, say,
influenza, as the former spreads much more rapidly and therefore needs a large number of susceptible 
humans to maintain permanence), and the endemic potential a pathogen has in a general 
human community. 
The idea of a critical community size does have its limitations, however. Most importantly, it 
only makes sense for non-zoonotic diseases. This is because the assumption of a critical community size 
is that the success of an epidemic (speaking strictly in terms of persistence) depends on the size of the
<i>human</i> population, and that transmission in that population only depends on human agents. A zoonotic disease,
however, does not require a human host to thrive, and so applying this concept to the study of a zoonosis 
would be nonsensical. The pathogen must also be transmitted via a human to human pathway. 
Malaria is a good illustration of this, as it cannot be transmitted from human to human, and so the depletion
of susceptibles does not rely solely on the density of humans in a community.
