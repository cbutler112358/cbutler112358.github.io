Classes ended a few weeks ago and I'm soaking up as much sun as possible. In place of tedious
coursework, I'm now free to focus on my research, both personal and otherwise! This is a welcome
respite, as these past two semesters have been difficult both because of the workload and
lack of any contiguous breaks during the semesters (the regular breaks were broken up and
 peppered throughout the 
semester as <q>wellness days</q>). However, next semester is already looking much better,
as classes are said to be in person and some level of normalcy will resume. Let's hope that this
decision is the correct one!
</p>

During the summer months I enjoy keeping myself busy with various personal projects 
concerning things I am interested in but never had the time to explore during the semester. My
research notebook is fat with ideas but now that I'm a graduate student, I've only a little 
more time than the regular semester to work on these things during the summer! That's quite alright
though, since there is considerable overlap between what I find interesting and my current research.
When I have the time, I'll be sure to post
updates on this blog. There is at least one project in the process of being posted, so stay tuned
for that. I've also been active elsewhere, making a blog post on the GG Scholars website about
inequities in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. You can read my post

In the meantime, enjoy the beginning of a project I started a year ago following my involvement in
a research program through the American Institute of Mathematics. The idea was
to construct a household model of COVID-19 with community transmission. Individuals would leave
their household units (modeled by well-connected graphs) and mix in a community network, 
modeled according to a B-A algorithm. The project never really took off, as I was starting
graduate school and had a million other things to do (like finding a place to live!), but I 
still managed to produce some interesting graphs. Please excuse the <q>jumbling</q>
of the graphs in the figure below! Since each household is an individual graph, it was very difficult
to get all the graphs to remain in the same place as the plots were updated. Oh well!
