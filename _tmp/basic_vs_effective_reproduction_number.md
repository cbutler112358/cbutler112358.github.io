Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been quite a bit of interest into how 
scientists study the spread of a disease in a population. Being able to quantify the ability
of a disease to spread is useful in both measuring its epidemic potential (whatever that
means) at any point in time, while also knowing how to roughly answer the question of <i>how much</i>
this quantity needs to be reduced before an epidemic is unable to spread. Thankfully, there exists such
a quantity: the <b> basic reproduction number</b>. Sometimes you'll see people refer to this as the
basic reproductive number/rate, but these refer to the same thing. The basic reproduction number for a
pathogen tells us how quickly it spreads in a completely naive population. 
</p>

<p>
The definition, from memory, is <i>the average number of secondary infections created by a single
case in a naive population</i>. More intuitively, it is the number of people on average that an 
infected person will create if they interact with only susceptible people. We characterize the population
as "naive" because disease spread in a previously exposed population is different from disease spread
in a population with no prior exposure to a pathogen (and thus no immunity). This distinction will be 
important later on. Note that this assumes ideal conditions for the pathogen, as this it is often not
the case!

Calculation of the basic reproduction number is rather straightforward, and the simplest calculation

Methods of calculating the basic reproduction number, however, are very different. In my own personal
experience, these include...
